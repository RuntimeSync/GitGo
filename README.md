# 🚀 Code Publisher

Code Publisher is a VS Code extension that automates publishing coding problem solutions (LeetCode and normal programming problems) to GitHub with a single command.

## ❓ Problem

Developers who solve coding problems daily and maintain GitHub repositories usually perform many repetitive manual steps:

- Creating folders for each problem  
- Naming and organizing files  
- Writing README files  
- Adding screenshots of outputs or submissions  
- Running git add, commit, and push commands  

This workflow is time-consuming, error-prone, and often leads to inconsistent repository structure. Over time, it discourages developers from maintaining well-organized solution repositories.

## ✅ Solution

Code Publisher eliminates this repetitive workflow by providing a one-click publishing system directly inside VS Code.

With a single command, the extension:

- Reads the active solution file  
- Detects programming language  
- Creates a problem-specific folder  
- Copies the solution into the folder  
- Generates a README.md automatically  
- Attaches optional screenshots (output / submission)  
- Runs git pull, add, commit, and push  

All operations happen locally, without requiring users to manually handle folders or Git commands.
